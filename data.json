How well does this system work? We make two observations. First, our voice contains frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (called the ‚Äúvoice band‚Äù). Second, for an antenna to operate efficiently, i.e., to convert most of the electrical signal to electromagnetic radiation, its dimension must be a significant fraction (e.g., 25%) of the wavelength. Unfortunately, a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz translates to a wavelength1 of 1.5 √ó 107m to 1.5 √ó 104 m, requiring gigantic antennas for each cell phone. Conversely, to obtain a reasonable antenna length, e.g., 5 cm, the wavelength must be around 20 cm and the frequency around 1.5 GHz.", "conc": "How do we ‚Äúconvert‚Äù the voice band to a gigahertz center frequency? One possible approach is to multiply the voice signal, x(t), by a sinusoid, A cos(2œÄfct) [Fig. 1.2(a)].

Thus, if fc = 1 GHz, the output occupies a bandwidth of 40 kHz centered at 1 GHz.
